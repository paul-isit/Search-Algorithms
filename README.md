# Search-Algorithms
This project incorporates different search algorithms that can be used to solve a maze with a start position, a goal and any obstructions if provided. These are basic algorithms which can be incorporated with learning and heuristics for better implementation.

# Instructions
The instructions are very straight forward

The maze information is provided to the program via the text file which has a specific format.

One can choose any of the following algorithms for the robot to use to solve the maze: bfs, dfs, gbfs, astar, iddfs and idastar.

(There are still a lot of areas for improvement in this project)
